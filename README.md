## Course Catalog Description 
Introduction to software engineering and computer programming. Systematic thinking process for problem solving in the context of software engineering. Group problem solving. Solving software engineering problems and presenting solutions through computer programs, written documents and oral presentations. Introduction to principles of programming, software design, and extensive practice in design, writing, running, debugging, and reasoning about programs.

## Learning Outcomes
After successful completion of SE 185, students are expected to acquire the following skills:
- Design and write computer programs to solve Computer engineering problems.
- Use common features of programming languages such as functions, loops, arrays, other data structures to design and evaluate solutions for engineering problems.
- Work in small teams to develop solutions to engineering problems.
- Write technical reports detailing the goal, alternative solutions, best solution, evaluations of multiple solutions, and conclusion for a given engineering problem.

## Learning Objectives
The purpose of this course is to introduce basic structures of programming such as data types, control flow, data structures, and storage as potential tools for solving and simulation of complex engineering problems. Labs will use programming and computational tools to complete computer engineering projects.
